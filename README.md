# Pico-Engine
A Turbowarp fan-project aiming to recreate FNF as a separate modding engine allowing my school to play the game unblocked while also being on an open source github repo (github is blocked at my school) allowing people outside of my school to use this for theyer own projects. (coded in Javascript)
